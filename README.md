The project-application is an online store, designed for the sale of photo equipment and products of photographic activities, but with a little change it can be a store of anything. Contains admin and user profiles. It is possible to create/delete users and prodcts with data and photos.
Only admin profiles can add products to the store, and regular users and admins can also make purchases.

File "BakBazaFotoProj" is a backup file of an already created database and it holds several users, admin and a couple of products.
